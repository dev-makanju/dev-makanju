I'm a motivated software engineer with experience in technical writing. I can turn excellent designs into responsive and functional front end code, and I have a track record of successful front end engineering projects. I have a strong interest in imparting knowledge on web engineering, documentation, and other subjects matters. I write technical content (on my [Blog](https://dev.to/miracool)). I'm also interested in developing software products and producing clear and straightforward documentation for developer.
